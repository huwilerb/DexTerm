# DexTerm 🩸🖥️

DexTerm is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) and a Command Line Interface (CLI)
designed to monitor and visualize glucose levels using the Dexcom API.
It allows users to fetch, display, and plot glucose data directly in the terminal,
providing a seamless experience for managing and tracking blood sugar levels.

Well, it's nothing yet, I just began to work on this project 💁‍♂️

## Features

- **Real-time Data Fetching**: Automatically fetch glucose data every 5 minutes.
- **Historical Data**: View and plot historical glucose data over customizable time ranges.
- **Terminal Plotting**: Visualize glucose data directly in the terminal using `plotille`.

- **Alarms and Notifications**: Set alarms for high/low glucose levels (feature in development).
